        <h3>European Championship always reflects the way we in Europe shape our lives together. 
            Four things in particular have stood out to me so far in this tournament. 
            On 12 June the continent felt close to a Danish football player.
             Christian Eriksen had to be resuscitated on the pitch. His teammates, 
             who immediately formed a circle around him, intuitively knew how to stand by him 
             in this stressful situation. It was palpable how much his privacy was worth to them and
              they protected his dignity in a difficult hour. It was an enormously moving event.
